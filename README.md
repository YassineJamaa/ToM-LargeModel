Welcome to the ```ToMechanisms``` repo! This is a Python package for doing incredible stuff (still in progress)

**Caution:**: this package is still under development and may change rapidly over the next few weeks.

## Setup
1. Create conda environment: `conda create -n llm-loc python=3.10`
2. Activate environment: `conda activate llm-loc`
3. Install packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Project Overview

The project consists of implementing an adapted contrast-based analysis method, inspired by task-based fMRI, to identify causal task-relevant neural units in large language models and vision-language models. By drawing parallels to the neuroscientific approach of isolating brain regions responsible for specific task, we apply this methodology to locate and study units critical for Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks.
